+ Projec title: ROCK Never out of Date
+ This project is conducted by Jinxiao Du

+ Project summary: After analzing the popularity trend among genres for past 50 years, Rock has always been most popular music genre. In order to figure out the reason, the project conducts sentiment analysis and get the conculsion that Rock, Metal and Jazz always convey different kinds of emotion. Next, showing people's preference towards different kinds of emotions for past 50 years, compared with extremely positive or negative emotion that Jazz and Metal conveys, a balance between positive and negative that Rock are always used to express attracts people, that's why Rock never out of date. Besides, for each kind of emotion, Rock still occupy a large proportion to convey it, which also contributes to the polularity of Rock.
